# BallerzOnly

A minimalist sports tracking solution for passionate fans and the casually curious.

## To run locally:

0. ensure Node is installed
1. Clone repository.
2. cd into BallerzOnly directory, run `npm install`
3. create .env file in the root (/BallerzOnly) folder and create an api endpoint variable called VITE_API_BASE_URL (this will have your localhost route to the api endpoint) ex. VITE_API_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:80/BallerzOnly/api/"
4. also create an api key variable called VITE_API_KEY, this will be the key for the NBA API.
4. `npm run dev` to start live server
