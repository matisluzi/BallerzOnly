# BallerzOnly

A minimalist sports tracking solution for passionate fans and the casually curious.

## To run locally:

0. ensure Node is installed
1. Clone repository.
2. cd into BallerzOnly directory, run `npm install`
3. create .env file in src/auth folder and create an api endpoint variable called VITE_API_BASE_URL (this will have your localhost route to the api endpoint)
3. `npm run dev` to start live server
